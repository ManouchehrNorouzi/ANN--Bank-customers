# ANN--Bank-customers
Predicting whether a customer will leave the bank or not

This is data from a bank to predict whether a customer will leave the bank or stay as a loyal customer.

The data is preprocessed including dealing with categorical variables(OneHotEncoding), train test split using sklearn, and finally standardizing using StandardScaler.

In the next step, an artificial neural network (ANN) model with 2 layers is fitted and the model is used to predict the behavior of a defined customer. The result was: "The customer stays loyal and does not leave the bank".
